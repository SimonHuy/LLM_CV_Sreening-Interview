Technical Question
----------
- Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and provide an example of how you would apply each in a talent acquisition context?
----------
Supervised Learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes. In talent acquisition, it can identify successful candidates based on historical data.
Unsupervised Learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. For example, it can cluster candidates by skills or experiences, helping HR understand candidate profiles better.

----------
## Evaluation of Candidate Response:

**Relevance:** The candidate's response is relevant to the question, focusing on the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and providing examples within the context of talent acquisition. 
**Relevance Score:** 90

**Correctness:** The candidate accurately describes the core concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning. Their examples are also appropriate and demonstrate understanding of the applications.
**Correctness Score:** 95

**Completeness:** While the candidate provides a good overview, the response could be more comprehensive. It lacks specific examples of algorithms or techniques used in each type of learning. 
**Completeness Score:** 80

**Overall Score:** 88.3

**Overall Feedback:** The candidate demonstrates a good understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning and their applications in talent acquisition. However, the response could benefit from more specific examples and a deeper exploration of the techniques used in each approach. 

Behavioral Question
----------
- Describe a time when you had to work with a large, complex dataset. How did you approach the challenge, and what were the key steps you took to ensure data quality and integrity?
----------
I worked on a large dataset to analyze customer behavior. I consolidated data from multiple sources, ensuring consistent formats. I cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values. To ensure quality and integrity, I performed exploratory analysis, validated against source systems, and implemented anomaly checks. Regular cross-checks with the team ensured the accuracy of the final analysis.
